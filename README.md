## Usage

### Prerequisites

Right now, our project can only be run on an emulated Android handheld device via Android Studio.

(We were so excited to just get the main features working in the final hours of the hackathon that we ran out of time to try to built it for easy distribution!)

### Installation

1. We recommend following the instructions at https://developer.android.com/studio/install to install Android Studio.

2. Download the project folder from GitHub

### Deployment

1. In Android Studio, click Open Project and navigate to the project folder

2. Click the Emulator Play button to load the app on an emulated Android Handheld device of your choice (our demo video shows it appearing on a Pixel 2).
